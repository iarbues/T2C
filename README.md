# T2C
MATLAB programs to perform tests of forecasting ability for 2 classes of models

We have the functions that actually perform the tests: critval_bootstrap_comp, grc_comp.
Then, we have the scrip that runs M simulations: pval_comp
Finally, we have the specific files for the different DGPs: simulaDGP1, sequenceDGP1, modelsDGP1.

Other files are obsolete but we will not remove them for now.
